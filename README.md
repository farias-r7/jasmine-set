jasmine-set brings rspec's `let` syntax to the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. The `set` global function is provided, which allows the spec writer to define lazy global accessors that can be refined in nested specs. To achieve this behavior, the `Suite.prototype.finish` function from Jasmine is wrapped.

##### Why not `let`?

In Ecmascript, `let` is a reserved word that allows for block-level scoping (as opposed to `var`, which is functionally-scoped).

### Sample Usage

    describe 'House', ->
      set 'opts',  -> {}
      set 'house', -> House.new(opts)

      it 'has a door', -> expect(@house).toHaveADoor()

      describe 'with no doors', ->
        set 'opts', -> { doors: 0 }

        it 'does not have a door', -> expect(@house).not.toHaveADoor()
